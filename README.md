Relax hack for [osu!](https://github.com/ppy/osu)

This was written for fun and using it in game will definetly get you banned. Dont cheat.

As of now, the only feature supported is clicking circles on time.

## Usage

The hack parses a beatmap passed as an argument like so:

`./relax beatmap.osu`

You can also simply drag a `.osu` file onto the executable.

After the map is done being parsed you will get this message: `Press [ENTER] to start relax`.

Press enter and relax.

## Improvements

- Add Hitscan capabilities
- Timing randomization
- BPM limits
- Different tapping styles (only alternating exists)
- Unstable rate goal (might be hard)
- Beatmap detection
- "Playing status" detection (it will spam keys when browsing the menu if active)

You can also add cursor movement to make it fully automated.
